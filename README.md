Finding Foodie is a simple project demonstrating the use of API integration in Salesforce. 
In this project, I have created a simple application where a Light Weight Component is added. This is reponsible for fetching the recipes of random food items based on the input given by the user in the search bar. Also, the user has an option to generate random recipes by clicking on the get random recipe button.
A simple REST API call is made at the backend and the result is diplayed on the screen.
